# c-data-structures
- Header-only library of simple generic data structures written in C99
	- array.h: static array
	- vector.h: dynamic array
	- map.h: hashmap with string keys
- What's useful about these?
	- They're very minimal (like anything in C)
		- Essential functions only
		- Everything else can be done with a loop
	- Fully generic, but also
		- No init macros (`vec_init(MyType);`) or any other boilerplate
		- Flexible syntax
			- Supports C99 designated initializers: `vec_push(v, (MyType){...})`
			- Vector and array elements can be accessed directly: `v[5] = 0;`
		- Mostly typesafe - uses type aliases, so no typedefs needed
			- array(T) -> T*
			- vector(T) -> T*
			- map(V) -> V**
- How to use
	- Just copy the files you want into your project folder and include them
	- Or I like to `sudo cp ./*.h /usr/local/include`
	- See `examples/` for how to use
